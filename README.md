## Customizing Your Pony




In this zip, there are 3 pony bases you can use to create your own pony along with 4 premade ponies. I have also included a texture guide so you can tell what is going on. Make sure the texture name is 'texture.png'




**FOOTNOTE:** 'texture_emission.png' is for magic auras. The transparency is 75%.




### EXTRA PARTS




You COULD add extra parts; there's enough space on 'texture.png' to support that. You just need to put into an existing group/bone or else it would just not animate with the rest of the body. You also need to at least know how to use Blockbench at the very least.
NOTE: every mesh within the "Hair" folder will be hidden upon wearing an helmet




(Technicallly you *could* replace entire parts just as long you keep the same bone structures, but I do *not* recommend it unless you know what you are doing.)




### The Rest




So you made your pony and satified with how it looks. Now you're almost done!




Obviously, change the name in 'avatar.json' to your pony's name. Then you have to go into 'initValue.lua' and there are three varibles on the top you want to change: "Magic", "Horn, and "Wings." Change them accordingly.




Now you have a Custom Pony!
